    <h2>Description</h2>
    "Thousand Layer" Chocolate Brioche – That's Just an Estimate

    You can probably count on one hand the number of times I've 
    made a recipe harder, or added extra steps, just so something 
    would look better, but that's exactly what I did with this "Thousand Layer" Chocolate Brioche. By the way, that's just a rough guess. There may be less than a thousand layers. Anyway, I find the look of all that flaky lamination irresistible, and in fairness, the texture is better as well.

If for whatever reason you wanted zero layers, you can simply make the brioche dough component as shown, roll it out, and cut it into the same size rectangles, and proceed with the cutting, filling, and knotting step. From a distance they will kind of look the same, and probably taste close, but don't forget, you'll be using four less tablespoons of butter, which is what we need for the lamination.

You could just add that amount of butter into the dough, so as not to be cheated, but fair warning, a dough with that much fat will rise very slowly, so plan accordingly. Feel free to stuff these with other goodies like nuts and dried fruit instead of, or in addition to, the chocolate chunks, but just be careful not to over fill. No matter if, or how, you
